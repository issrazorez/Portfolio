                Welcome to my portfolio! I'm <span id = "name">Issra Zorez</span>, a passionate artist with a love for graphic 
                design, film, and media. Through personal projects, freelance work, and collaborations, 
                I've been exploring these artistic realms, honing my skills, and pushing the boundaries 
                of my imagination. Graphic design fascinates me with its visual communication potential, 
                while film and media allow me to tell compelling stories that resonate with audiences. 
                I invite you to immerse yourself in my artistic world, where each piece represents my 
                dedication, creativity, and growth as an artist.
